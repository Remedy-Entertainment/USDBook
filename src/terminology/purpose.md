# Purpose


_Purpose_ is an attribute that can be used to give a prim and its descendants high-level "purpose" with regards to rendering. It's akin to "visibility grouping" where the groups' toggling is defined by the renderer.  
For example, if a prim has its `purpose` attribute set to `render`, it will be excluded from being drawn in a DCC viewport that only wants to draw `proxy` prims.

In some sense, setting purpose could be considered [Stage Traversal](./stage_traversal.md) but for a renderer.


Currently, only 4 values are supported by the `purpose` attribute:

| Purpose    | Description | 
|--------------|-----------|
| `default` | The prim has no special rendering purpose and it will be included in all rendering paths      |
| `guide`      | A prim tree marked with `guide` is generally used by interactive applications that have asked to show "guides". Think of it as requesting to visualize controller geometry for rigs, skeleton data, etc  |
| `proxy`      | Proxy is usually reserved for a lightweight representation of another object to be used in an interactive renderer such as a DCC viewport  |
| `render`      | The "final quality" data to be imaged. Usually enabled for offline rendering, path tracing, etc  |

Unlike [Kind](./kind.md). `purpose` cannot be extended with custom values!

The example below toggles between "proxy" and "render" purposes in the viewport's Display settings.

```admonish example title="Example Switching between proxy and render Purposes"
![purpose](../images/terminology/purpose.gif)
```

In the image below, `/root/GEO` has its purpose set to `render`, it will only be drawn when the active renderer requests prims with a `render` purpose.
```admonish example title="Render Purpose"
![renderpurpose](../images/terminology/purpose_render.png)
```

In the image below, `/root/GEO_PROXY` has its purpose set to `proxy`, it will only be drawn when the active renderer requests prims with a `proxy` purpose.

```admonish example title="Proxy Purpose"
![proxypurpose](../images/terminology/purpose_proxy.png)
```

```admonish note title=""
Purpose for a viewport is not an exclusive toggle, it is possible to have both `proxy` _and_ `render` prim hierarchies active
