# USD Terminology

With introductions out of the way, the following chapters will focus exclusively on the core terminology needed to be able to understand USD. It will be mucher easier to follow any tutorial on USD if you understand the fundamental jargon first.

It is recommended to read the pages within this chapter in order.

```admonish warning
The contents within this chapter do not aim to be exhaustive as many concepts are overly simplified and others are simply missing.

This is in other words **_not a replacement for the [official USD Glossary](https://graphics.pixar.com/usd/release/glossary.html)_** and it is strongly advised to read those pages afterwards.
