# Reference

## Layer References
Beyond sublayers, layers can also be grafted underneath prims. Using the example Cube and Sphere from [Local/Sublayer](./local_sublayer.md), we can also create prims and have them point to a these layers respectively.

```admonish example title="Layer referencing"
![reference_1](../images/terminology/reference_1.png)
![reference_2](../images/terminology/reference_2.png)
```

## Local References
While the general use-case is to use layers when referencing, it is not required to do so. It is entirely possible to add a reference to a prim within the same layer. This is known as a local reference

```admonish example title="Local referencing"
![reference_3](../images/terminology/reference_3.png)
![reference_4](../images/terminology/reference_4.png)
```

You would merely need to add a reference to the target prim and its entire hierarchy will be grafted underneath:

```
def "ReferenceToFoo"(
        prepend references=</foo>
) {
}
```

# Layer Prim References
But, this goes even further! Remember, composition acts on layer stacks, not individual layers; so it is also possible to reference specific prims from another layer's layer stack. Even if these prims themselves are the composed result from the target layer's layer stack

```admonish example title="Layer Prim referencing"
![reference_5](../images/terminology/reference_5.png)
![reference_6](../images/terminology/reference_6.png)
```

```
def "ReferenceToPrim"(
    prepend references= @./several_prims.usd@</A_Capsule>
) {
    float3 xformOp:translate = (3, 0, 0)
    uniform token[] xformOpOrder = ["xformOp:translate"]
}
```
