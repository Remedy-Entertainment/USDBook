# Motivation

Universal Scene Description (USD) is already making big waves in the VFX/Film and Games industries, with large players such as [NVidia](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/omniverse/), [Apple](https://opensource.apple.com/projects/usd/) and [Autodesk](https://makeanything.autodesk.com/usd) jumping on the technology. But as a newcomer; it can be an incredibly daunting and frustrating journey to venture into.

This book's driving motivation is to offer a _succinct, beginner-friendly and structured_ way of introducing USD, its concepts and terminology. At the moment this book focusses predominantly on terminology, but will be expanded upon with workflow examples in the future.

```admonish question title="You may be wondering at this point"
 _Why read this book instead the [official USD Glossary](https://graphics.pixar.com/usd/release/glossary.html) and [Tutorials](https://graphics.pixar.com/usd/release/tut_usd_tutorials.html)?_
```

Jumping head-first into the [official USD Glossary](https://graphics.pixar.com/usd/release/glossary.html) or [Tutorials](https://graphics.pixar.com/usd/release/tut_usd_tutorials.html) is a perfectly valid strategy; unfortunately, the reality is that USD is a very complex machine with many moving parts intertwined with one another. Simply trying out USD's bundled applications like `USDView` can be quite involved if you're not a software engineer.  
Many concepts are also tied to the hip, as such it can be very easy to drown in terminology. This kind of "rabbit-hole-diving" method of learning can be incredibly confusing and overwhelming.

This book offers an alternative path to that.

```admonish note title="Author's Note"
At [Remedy Entertainment](https://www.remedygames.com), we absolutely <font color=Red>‚ù§</font> USD! We even gave [a talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FI2pyzTOvaQ) about how we are using it to make AAA games!

After the aforementioned presentation, we were asked to release our internal documentation on USD itself publicly as we had written a more simplified subset of the [official USD Glossary](https://graphics.pixar.com/usd/release/glossary.html). This book is that documentation, albeit cleaned up, rewritten and adjusted for `mdbook` compatibility.

We are releasing this with a permissive license, so you are free to fork/copy/change your version of this book as you see fit.
